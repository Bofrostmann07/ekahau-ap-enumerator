### How to use
*You need to run this program as an administrator!*

Rename AP with Strg+r. The hostname counter will automatically count one up.  
You can manuelly manipulate the hostname counter by pressing page up / page down.  
To change the hostname or counter value, you need to press the 'Set' button.  
By adding leading zeros to the counter value field, you also change the width of the counter value field.
